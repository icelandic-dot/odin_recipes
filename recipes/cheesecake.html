                    <li> 1 cup sugar </li>
                    <li> 2/3 cups sour cream </li>
                    <li> 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract </li>
                    <li> 1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li> 4 large eggs</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
    
        </ul>

        <h3> Steps </h3>

        <ol>
            <li> Preheat overn to 160C. </li>
            <li> Prepare Graham Cracker crust first by combining graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and brown sugar, and stir it well. Add melted butter and use a fork to combine ingredients well. </li>
            <li> Pour crumbs into a 9 inch Springform pan and press firmly into the bottom and up sides of your pan. Set aside. </li>
        </ol>
            
        <ul> <li> <h4> Cheesecake </h4> </ul>
                <ol>
                    <li> In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl (using a hand mixer) add cream cheese and stir until smooth and creamy (don’t over-beat or you’ll incorporate too much air). </li>
                    <li> Add sugar and stir again until creamy. </li>
                    <li> Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and salt, and stir until well-combined. If using a stand mixer, make sure you pause periodically to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula so that all ingredients are evenly incorporated. </li>
                    <li> Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and salt, and stir until well-combined. If using a stand mixer, make sure you pause periodically to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula so that all ingredients are evenly incorporated. </li>
                    <li> Pour cheesecake batter into prepared springform pan. To insure against leaks, place pan on a cookie sheet that’s been lined with foil. </li>
                    <li> Transfer to the center rack of your oven and bake on 325F (160C) for about 75 minutes. Edges will likely have slightly puffed and may have just begun to turn a light golden brown and the center should spring back to the touch but will still be Jello-jiggly. Don't over-bake or the texture will suffer, which means we all suffer. </li>
                    <li> Remove from oven and allow to cool on top of the oven³ for 10 minutes. Once 10 minutes has passed, use a knife to gently loosen the crust from the inside of the springform pan (this will help prevent cracks as your cheesecake cools and shrinks). </li>    
                    <li> Allow cheesecake to cool another 1-2 hours or until near room temperature before transferring to refrigerator and allowing to cool overnight or at least 6 hours. Enjoy! </li>
                </ol>
