        <ul>
            <li> 4 Tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li> 3 cups sweet or yellow onion </li>
            <li> 1 1/2 Tablespoons minced garlic </li>
            <li> 1 1/2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour </li>
            <li> 2 800gr cans whole peeled tomatoes </li>
            <li> 2 cups chicken broth </li>
            <li> 1/4 cup finely sliced basil </li>
            <li> 2 Tablespoons granulated sugar </li>
            <li> 1/4 teaspoon table salt </li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
            <li> 1/3 v </li>
            <li> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda </li>
            <li> Shredded or grated parmesan cheese </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Steps </h3>

        <ol>
            <li> Place butter in a large pot over medium heat and cook until melted. </li>
            <li> Add diced onion and cook until translucent. </li>
            <li> Add garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds). </li>
            <li> Sprinkle flour into the pot and use a spatula to stir until no lumps remain. Continue to cook another 30-60 seconds. </li>
            <li> Add tomatoes and their juices, crushing and smashing them with your spatulas and scraping the bottom of the pot as you add them until no large pieces remain. </li>
            <li> Stir in chicken broth, basil, sugar, salt and black pepper and stir well. </li>
            <li> Bring soup to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 20-30 minutes to allow the flavors to develop. </li>
            <li> After simmering, use an immersion blender to puree the soup until completely smooth (alternatively, puree the soup in batches using a traditional blender and then return to the pot). </li>
            <li> Stir in cream and baking soda, stirring until smooth, cohesive in color, and not foamy. Taste-test and add salt and pepper as needed. </li>
            <li> Portion into bowls and serve topped with grated parmesan cheese. This soup is excellent for dipping grilled cheese or just served with a side salad and some crusty artisan bread! </li>
        </ol>
