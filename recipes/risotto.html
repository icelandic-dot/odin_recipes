        <p> 
            A <strong> delicious </strong> Creamy Risotto - made with mainly store cupboard ingredients. 
        </p>
    
        <h3> Ingredients </h3>

        <ul>
            <li> 4 cups chicken broth </li>
            <li> 4 Tablespoons unsalted butter </li>
            <li> 1 heaping cup Arborio rice </li>
            <li> 1/4 cup white wine </li>
            <li> 1 medium yellow or sweet onion, finely chopped </li>
            <li> 1 cup fresh shredded parmesan cheese </li>
            <li> 1 Tablespoon fresh parsley </li>
            <li> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
            <li> salt </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Steps </h3>

        <ol>
            <li> Pour chicken broth into a medium-sized saucepan and place over medium-low heat. You want this to be warm and stay warm while you are preparing the risotto. </li>
            <li> In a separate, large skillet, melt 3 Tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Once melted, add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened - about 3-5 minutes. </li>
            <li> Add rice and use a spatula to turn until all of the rice is coated with butter (none of the grains should appear dry. Cook another minute or two, stirring, until you can smell the fragrance of lightly toasted rice. </li>
            <li> Drizzle wine into pan and cook, stirring, until all wine is evaporated, there should not be any liquid in the bottom of the pan and you should not be able to smell the fragrance of the wine in the steam anymore. </li>
            <li> Add about 1/3 cup of warm chicken broth and stir frequently. Once the broth has been cooked out, repeat with additional wine and repeat until you have added all of the broth or rice is al-dente - cooked through but still firm to-the-tooth. You may need more liquid, if so use more broth or simply warm water. </li>
            <li> Once rice is cooked and rolls back in on itself when you slide through the saucepan with a spatula, it is finished cooking. Remove from the heat at once and add the remaining Tablespoon of butter, parmesan cheese, and parsley. </li>
            <li> Stir until butter and cheese are melted, taste and add more pepper and salt if needed. Serve immediately, as risotto does not keep well and storing is not recommended. </li>
        </ol>
